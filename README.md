# IMDb Clone

Welcome to **IMDb Clone**, a React-based web application that provides movie enthusiasts with an intuitive platform to discover, favorite, and search for films. This project is inspired by IMDb.

## Overview

This is my first React project, designed to replicate key features of IMDb while implementing personalized functionalities:
- A **Home Page** displaying the most popular movies, fetched via my custom API using data from [The Movie Database (TMDb)](https://www.themoviedb.org).
- A **Favorites Page**, where users can save movies to their favorites list, stored locally for quick access.
- A **Search Feature** leveraging the API to allow users to look up movies by title.

## Technologies Used
- **React:** For building the dynamic user interface.
- **JavaScript:** To power application logic and interactivity.
- **Custom API:** To fetch data from TMDb and serve it to the front-end.
- **Local Storage:** To persist user favorites across sessions.
- **CSS:** To style the application.
